# zksync500

Uses Solidity smart contract to store created short links mapping to pre-determined data from user (including description).
Has wallet integration with several providers.
Works with contract deployed to mainnet.
Tried using zinc, realized probably not ready yet (proof in the pudding there).
Allows users to select currency and see fee, change fee currency.

Dead simple to use.
